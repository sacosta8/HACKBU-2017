      "description":"A news editor at Wired.com, Kevin Lee Poulsen is a former hacker whose most remarkable hack was when he took over the telephone lines of the entire Los Angeles-based radio station KIIS-FM as he intended to make sure that he would be the 102nd caller in order to win a Porsche 944 S2.  After he was released from prison, he decided to leave the computer programming world and become a journalist to distance himself from his criminal past."
